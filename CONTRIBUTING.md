# Contributing

This resource is first-and-foremost a learning experience for myself. 

I won't be taking contributions that add new notes. Contributions should be made to fix grammar, formatting and readability. Any issues with content should be raised as an issue for me to fix myself.

This may change in the future, most likely in the case that I finish university, or that I cannot commit the time to past modules.
